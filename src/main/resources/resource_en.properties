index.jsp.text.example_title = An example of an algorithm for calculating the cost of transportation on the example of delivery of goods from Kiev to Zaporozhye:
index.jsp.text.example = Determine the weight (kg) and volume (m3) of the cargo. Suppose that the weight of the cargo is 35 kg, volume - 0.1 m3. From Kiev to Zaporozhye, the tariff by weight is 4 UAH / kg or by volume - 1000 UAH / m3. UAH 15 and payment of the value of the cargo (0.6% of the declared value). The cost of transportation by weight is: 35 × 5 = UAH 175. The cost of transportation by volume: 0.1 × 1000 = UAH 100. Because when determining the cost of transportation taking into account the greater value of the assessment by weight or volume, the transportation of cargo weighing 35 kg and a volume of 0.1 m3 from Kiev to Zaporozhye will be 175 UAH. So, the total cost of transportation will be 175 UAH.
